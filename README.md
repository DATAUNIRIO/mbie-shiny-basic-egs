## Basic examples using Shiny with Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's data

These are experimental and should not be relied upon to be error-free; nor should they be expected to be fully polished or provide great user experiences.  The whole point of the exercise is just to do some experimentation with Shiny, to see what it can do.

Working versions of the apps here can be found at:
